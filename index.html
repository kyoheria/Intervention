      <h5 class="w3-center">Washington Square</h5>

      <p class="w3-large">1. History: </p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Washington Square Park is named for George Washington (1732-1799), the commander of the Continental Army, who was inaugurated in New York City as the first President of the United States on April 30, 1789.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Used first as the Washington Military Parade Ground in 1826, the site became a public park in 1827.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">the square was redesigned and improved by M.A. Kellogg, Engineer-in-Chief, and I.A. Pilat, Chief Landscape Gardener in 1870</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">providing a more rustic and informal space with curvilinear paths along its periphery, retaining many of the diagonal paths within the park’s core, and defining plots of grass with shade trees and carriage drive through the park's interior connecting Fifth Avenue to Lower Manhattan.
      Washington Arch, designed by noted architect Stanford White, was built between 1890-1892 and replaced a wooden arch erected in 1889 to honor the centennial of the first president’s inauguration.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">Washington Square Park was redefined socially and culturally throughout the 20th century. </p> 
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The late 1960s and early 1970s saw the lowering of the fountain and creation of a two-tiered central plaza which cemented its reputation as an ad hoc performance space.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">In the 1990s both playgrounds were upgraded, petanque courts built at a "teen plaza" in the southeast park precinct, and a dog run was introduced.</p>
      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium">The second phase (2012) provided a small dog run, a new chess plaza, a performance stage, renovated petanque courts, as well as enhanced landscaping, lighting and pathways, and the relocation and conservation of the statue of Garibaldi. The third and final phase, completed in 2014, features BKSK Architects' new LEED-certified park house and comfort station, whose subtle curvature, reclaimed wood, stone palette and low profile integrate with the lush surroundings.</p>

    	<p>For intervention 1, we decided to use a music conponent and making beat box kind of interactive space in the public space using a cheap material</p>
    	<p>We set up a small speaker, drawed grid with choke, and set up loaptop with premade 6 diffierent beats</p>
      <p>As we were doing the intervention we noticed that people who are passing by do not notice the things on the groud or small music. However, when people noticed what is going on had fun talking to each other figuring out what is going on and also came to us to find out what is actually going on</p>
      <p>What we decided to change</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">1. Make a music louder</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">2. Make a gird more noticable to step on</p>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">3. Change a type of music so poeple notice the difference more</p>

    <div class="w3-col m6 w3-padding-large w3-hide-small">
	    <p>For the second intervention, we dicided to look at few precidencebefore we started to develop the idea.</p>
	    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrk9lRWh8Pg" title="W3.CSS" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">Interactive music/sound installation at Stockholm Central Station</a></p>

	    <p>From these we took the idea of having the foot mark and also making the grid different texture than groud of the Washington Square. Also we decided to change the beats to music that is done by different instlament such as: band, piano, string orchestra, acoustic guitar, electronic, 8 bit. Also we got bigger speaker, moved the operation system to the phone instead of the laptop.</p>
      <p>As the Demo video shows, many of the chids enjoyed intracting with the intervention. Many of them jumped around, trrigered so many musics. That that cuteness attracted others interest and many people looked at and tryed.</p>
      <p>since we tryed to make it look like a WIZARD OF OZ type of prototype, we tryed to not stay in the group and kept moving around the area to be not made by people who are intracting with the intervention. Roughly about 30 people interacted with our intervention and only 5 people in total came up to one of the member to talk about the project.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>If we continue work on this project we whould like to move this project and see what kind of impact the location has to this project and also start looking in to wha tkind of technical sensor or and kind of technology best fit to the core intraction this project offeres. We think the best part we developed in this peoject is the interaction that could happen in the open public space to bring strengers together, and we do not wan to lose that part of project by fixing our idea on the type of techology. The observation will continuesly be the imprtant part of the project and because our audience is huge and diversed, we need to keep observing how people lie to intearct with and maybe interview people who intracted with the project to see what draw these people and see what they like and what they didn't like about.</p>
